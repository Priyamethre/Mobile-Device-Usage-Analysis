# Mobile-Device-Usage-Analysis

##  Overview
This project aims to analyze mobile device usage patterns and user behavior using a dataset comprising various features, including app usage time, screen-on time, battery consumption, and data usage. The primary objective is to predict user behavior classes and derive meaningful insights into mobile usage trends.

By examining these attributes, the study seeks to uncover valuable insights that can inform app development strategies, optimize device performance, and enhance user engagement models. A key focus of the analysis is the segmentation of data based on age and gender to identify patterns and trends across different demographic groups. This includes assessing variations in data consumption, screen-on time, and app usage, as well as analyzing the distribution of user behavior classes across diverse user categories.
 ## Business Problem
 People use their mobile phones in different waysâ€”some use them minimally, while others are heavy users. Businesses, such as app developers and mobile service providers, need to understand user behavior to optimize services, recommend relevant apps, and improve battery management.By predicting user behavior class, companies can:
* Provide personalized app recommendations.

* Optimize mobile network data plans.

* Improve battery performance and user experience.
